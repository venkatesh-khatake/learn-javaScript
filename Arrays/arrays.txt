Arrays :
    Arrays are data structure that allows you to store multiple values
    in a single variable.
    It's like a list or collection of items.

Syntax : let arr = [1,2,4];

    Arrays are zero indexed, meaning the first element has an index of 0, 
    the second has an index of 1 and so on.
